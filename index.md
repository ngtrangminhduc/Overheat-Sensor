**December 09, 2018**: Finished ReadMe.md . It is displayed in the main repository.

**November 27, 2018**: Presenting my product to the whole class! Presentation can be found <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngtrangminhduc/OverheatSensor/master/2018_Documentation/Presentations/Presentation%20-%20Nov%2027.pptx">here</a>

**November 20, 2018**: Finished designing and laser printing the Raspberry Pi Case. I will drill the screws tomorrow. The CorelDraw design can be found <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngtrangminhduc/OverheatSensor/master/2018_Documentation/Pi%20Case%20-%20Overheat%20Sensor.cdr">here</a>

**November 14, 2018**: Demonstrated running code to professor in class. I also updated the budget. 

#Progress Report: The project has meet its requirement, functionality and budget-wise. I'm still trying to implement the screen to show the result from the sensor, as it requires more work than it seems.

**November 6, 2018**: Finished Soldering the essential parts. A LED I2C screen can still be implemented on the PCB, but I'm still testing it as it's not fully functional yet. I accidentally bought a 6-header stackable pin instead of 4, so the professor helped me turn it into a 4-header one.

**October 30, 2018**: Finished desigining my PCB and emailed it to Prototype Lab. The file can be found <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngtrangminhduc/OverheatSensor/master/2018_Documentation/Fritzing/DucNguyen_HDC1008.fzz">here</a>

**October 23, 2018**: Demonstrated my sensor to Kristian. The code worked, but the address was not the desired one. After researching, I know how to change the address from 0x40 to 0x42 through Adafruit, by using pinout A0 and A1 (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-hdc1008-temperature-and-humidity-sensor-breakout/pinouts). However, since Adafruit has discontinued this product, I had to buy the ones without those pinouts.I tried changing the code and even used 3rd party programs, but none worked.

The sensor is working perfectly fine under 0x40.
The screen is not needed, as data can be shown on the monitor

**October 21, 2018**: Finished the Python code.

**October 20, 2018**: Started writing the code for the sensor. I tried both Python and C and had problems with both.

**October 18, 2018**: Started the Raspberry Pi Installation. For me the NOOBS didn't work, but flashing the Raspbian ISO file into the SD card worked.

**October 16, 2018**: Showed acquisitions to Kristian, finished UML diagram and soldering
